Introduction : 

at the very foundation this game project was intended to be a board game. I actually already created a material version of it, but due to life tricks, i'v lost half of it. Anyhow the idea kept haunting me. And, i've still gone on drawing, modeling, re/thinking the different concepts sometimes.

Before saying anything else, let me introduce the game itself, I named «Crypte Duel».
«Crypte Duel» is at a time a turn based strategy game like «Stratego» (if you know about it), a board RPG like «Warhamer» and a card playing game all set in a medieval gothic environment. I'll not go as far as unraveling the planed features of the game just yet as nothing is set in stone right now, and i'll gladly accept constructive criticism from the team i'm planing to form.

That said, a word about me. I'm Idolord, Im a graphic artist both 2D, 3D (organic/non-organic) modeler and coder. I love above all learning new stuff, thinking hard and experimenting.

The work i'v done so far : 

I'v made classes for the world generation, the zone map is extracted form the color pixel of a png file, definition for zone from a txt file. Then each tile map is extracted from a corresponding png file coupled with a txt file providing tile information. It finally instantiates tiles (a cubic GameObject) based on each zone tile map. This will provide high potential for map modding and community based mod, and I feel is easier to work with. For now any tile is the same object, but its parameters are set at instantiation, feeding it type&material.


Payment : 

I'm starting things up right now as nothing is set in stone. But my plan of action would be, starting the project as a free work. As it grows, and based on donation, interested people will get on our project, and a common will of the team. will go indy and any member will get the same bill out of the project earning and any remainings of the budget will go to get pro licences for the team. We can maybe try to kick start it upon main free alpha phase.


People Needed : 

first world, I'm looking for people who love board games. Have heard of Elixir, love to play Smallworld2, Stone age, Agricola, Colon Catane, Magics, even Bonanza ? You're in !Second word, anybody can be and should be at multiple Roles and involved in the overall project. I'm looking for people who, as I do, love learning new stuff. A final word about it, the overall team spirit I'm aiming for is : open mindedness.
