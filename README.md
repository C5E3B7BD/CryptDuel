#Introduction

At the soul of this project lies a board game.
I had actually already created a material version of it but, due to life's tricks, lost half of it. Despite this, however, the idea stayed with me, and I've still gone on drawing, modelling, [re]thinking and inventing different concepts.

Before saying anything else; let me introduce the game itself. I named **Crypte Duel**.
**Crypte Duel** is a turn based strategy game like [**Stratego**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego) (if you know about it), a board RPG like [**Warhamer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Battle) and a card playing game. All set in a medieval Gothic environment. 
I'll not go as far as revealing the planed features of the game just yet as nothing is set in stone right now, and I'll gladly accept constructive criticism. **Crypte Duel** is based on Unity, but this may change according to team members ability. 

That said, a word about me.

I'm Idolord, I'm a graphic artist both in 2D, organic and non-organic 3D modeller and programmer. Above all, I love learning new stuff, thinking hard, and experimenting.

#Work I've accomplished thus far

1. Created classes for world generation
  a.The zone map is extracted from pixel colours extracted from an image<!--- definition for zone from a txt file. -->
  b.Each tile map is extracted from a corresponding image file coupled with a text file providing tile information
  c.Finally the engine instantiates tiles based on each zone in the tile map
	*This will provide high potential for map and community-based modding (and is potentially easier to work with)

#Payment

I'm starting things up right now as nothing is set in stone. But my plan of action would be, starting the project as a free work. As it grows, and based on donation, interested people will get on our project, and a common will of the team. will go indy and any member will get the same bill out of the project earning and any remainings of the budget will go to get pro licences for the team. We can maybe try to kick start it upon main free alpha phase.
